Second approach is more modern, but we'll get to it later

What PRIVATE does? Weâ€™ll get to it later ;)

# Basic usage as developer - linking libraries

# Basic usage as developer - summing up

```cmake

project(my_project)

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -pedantic")

add_executable(main main.cpp)
target_include_directories(main PRIVATE "dir/some_nice_library/include")
target_link_directories(main PRIVATE "dir/spooky_scary_lib/lib")
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE spooky_scary_lib)
```

.info[
This simple example allows us to get ourselves a very basic, but extendable buildsystem
